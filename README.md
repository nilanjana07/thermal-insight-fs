Thermalytics

Thermo-Insights is a web-based tool designed for analyzing thermal images to provide preliminary health diagnostics. The application allows users to upload thermal images, input patient details, and generate a detailed analysis report, which can be downloaded as a PDF. Further, a secondary route also allows user to convert their greyscale images to coloured heatmaps. 
To make further enhancements, we are looking into integrating the Gemini API.
